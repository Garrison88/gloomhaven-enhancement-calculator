  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: PirataOne
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/pirata_one.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
    - family: HighTower
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/high_tower.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
