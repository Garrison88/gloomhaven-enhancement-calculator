flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    # - icons/
    - images/
    - images/class_icons/
    # - images/class_images/
    # - images/class_mats/back/
    # - images/class_mats/front/
    - images/equipment_slots/
    - images/attack_modifiers/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: PirataOne
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/pirata_one.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    - family: HighTower
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/high_tower.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    - family: Nyala
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/nyala.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
