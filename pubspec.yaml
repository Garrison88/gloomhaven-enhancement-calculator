flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  # - icons/
  - images/
  - images/class_icons/
  - images/equipment_slots/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: PirataOne
    fonts:
    - asset: fonts/pirata_one.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  - family: HighTower
    fonts:
    - asset: fonts/high_tower.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  - family: Nyala
    fonts:
    - asset: fonts/nyala.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
